NB: The concept of randomized monster spellbooks has been removed:

https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/bc7614a589d44ba8a134ede3e547d9d85f470a25
this commit removed multi-books as-a-thing from most mons, except deep elf mages and liches

https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/97bf95f3a4eb27709f8eba932d03cda88303a32d
https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/4c84cb832125a208706bc18fce23bec912d4fb57
deep elf mages and liches multibooks, removed

https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/3d1ca0d2d81d10d4c5f25e9f2ea6d83abcc60257
this commit removed the underlying multi-book code

At time of writing, dcss.io was never regenerated after those commits:
https://doc.dcss.io/modules/monster.html#monster.info:spells
still references the obsolete behavior.

Part of this commit updated the moninf_get_spells function, as monster
multi-books were removed. This function comment in l-moninf.cc may read as
though monster multi-books remain a concept somewhere, but they aren't.
Currently, this lua bind appears to return an un-named table representing {book},
containing a table of {spell names}.

note: this bind does *not* return draconian breath attacks as known spells.
I have no idea if any other monster natural abilities are missed by this bind.
I briefly tested some non-draconians, and their natural abilities were all
listed as spells, but it's probably safer to assume this bind is unreliable.

note: if i do a tostring() on a raw mons table entry like this:

table.insert(threat_table, {mons, threat[2]})
crawl.mpr(tostring(threat_table[1]))

crawl emits some memory hexadecimal (probably the hex of the userdata mons subtable pointer?)
